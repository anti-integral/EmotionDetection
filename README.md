# EmotionDetectionOmSanan

First, dowload the FER2013 dataset from kaggle.
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/deadskull7/fer2013

They open emotion_detection.py for the code - the link for the Colab notebook is:

If any of the modules are not installed, use the pip install <module> command.

If you want, access the fModel.h5 in the repository using the load model functiol located after the model training. You will need to add it to the sketch first. It is only trained with 25 epochs so it won't be acurate. I used a more acurate one that was able to get better accuracy.

The you can upload the testing folder or images in your drive if you want to use the testing images I used. Otherwise, use the X_Test images.

*Note* - If you want your model to train much faster, get colab pro or use a different software.
